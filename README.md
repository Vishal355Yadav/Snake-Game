# Snake-Game
This is a Snake Game developed using Python. This is a similar game that we played in our childhood in which a moving Snake eat the randomly generated food and becomes 
larger and larger. The game ends when the snake eat itself.
This game is similar to that only.
The game terminates with the collision of the snake with itself. At the every stage the score the score of the game increases as the snake eats the food and become larger.
The highest score is also updated if the score is greater than the previus highest.
